# Swedish Twitter

Here I will gather some data collections from the Swedish Twitter.

## Trends from Swedish Twitter
Twitter trends from Stockholm, GÃ¶teborg and Sweden from 2014-12-18 to 2016-03-29. All trends were collected every 8 hours. Each CSV file contains about 25,000 collected trends.

Although there are no headers in the CSV file, the headers is simply <code>datetime, trend</code>.


## Members of Swedish Parliament (Riksdagen)

A CSV file of MP's from Riksdagen with the header <code>Name; Party; Twittername</code> (separated by semi-colon).

The list contains 278 Twitter accounts from 349 MP's (80 %). The list is likely to be incomplete and may contain errors. (It's better to store the ID of each Twitter account.)
